type ()

type Config struct {
	//! Map memory pages for the given number of bytes. The returned address MUST be
	//  aligned to the rpmalloc span size, which will always be a power of two.
	//  Optionally the function can store an alignment offset in the offset variable
	//  in case it performs alignment and the returned pointer is offset from the
	//  actual start of the memory region due to this alignment. The alignment offset
	//  will be passed to the memory unmap function. The alignment offset MUST NOT be
	//  larger than 65535 (storable in an uint16_t), if it is you must use natural
	//  alignment to shift it into 16 bits. If you set a memory_map function, you
	//  must also set a memory_unmap function or else the default implementation will
	//  be used for both.
	MemoryMap uintptr
	//! Unmap the memory pages starting at address and spanning the given number of bytes.
	//  If release is set to non-zero, the unmap is for an entire span range as returned by
	//  a previous libfuzzerCall to memory_map and that the entire range should be released. The
	//  release argument holds the size of the entire span range. If release is set to 0,
	//  the unmap is a partial decommit of a subset of the mapped memory range.
	//  If you set a memory_unmap function, you must also set a memory_map function or
	//  else the default implementation will be used for both.
	MemoryUnmap uintptr
	//! Called when an assert fails, if asserts are enabled. Will use the standard assert()
	//  if this is not set.
	ErrorCallback uintptr
	//! Called when a libfuzzerCall to map memory pages fails (out of memory). If this callback is
	//  not set or returns zero the library will return a null pointer in the allocation
	//  libfuzzerCall. If this callback returns non-zero the map libfuzzerCall will be retried. The argument
	//  passed is the number of bytes that was requested in the map libfuzzerCall. Only used if
	//  the default system memory map function is used (memory_map callback is not set).
	MapFailCallback uintptr
	//! Size of memory pages. The page size MUST be a power of two. All memory mapping
	//  requests to memory_map will be made with size set to a multiple of the page size.
	//  Used if RPMALLOC_CONFIGURABLE is defined to 1, otherwise system page size is used.
	PageSize uintptr
	//! Size of a span of memory blocks. MUST be a power of two, and in [4096,262144]
	//  range (unless 0 - set to 0 to use the default span size). Used if RPMALLOC_CONFIGURABLE
	//  is defined to 1.
	SpanSize uintptr
	//! Number of spans to map at each request to map new virtual memory blocks. This can
	//  be used to minimize the system libfuzzerCall overhead at the cost of virtual memory address
	//  space. The extra mapped pages will not be written until actually used, so physical
	//  committed memory should not be affected in the default implementation. Will be
	//  aligned to a multiple of spans that match memory page size in case of huge pages.
	SpanMapCount uintptr
	//! Enable use of large/huge pages. If this flag is set to non-zero and page size is
	//  zero, the allocator will try to enable huge pages and auto detect the configuration.
	//  If this is set to non-zero and page_size is also non-zero, the allocator will
	//  assume huge pages have been configured and enabled prior to initializing the
	//  allocator.
